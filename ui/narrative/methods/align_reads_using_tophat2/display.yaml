parameters :
    input_ref :
        ui-name : |
            RNAseqSample(Set) or ReadsLibrary
        short-hint : |
            Select the RNA-seq SampleSet for alignment. If you have only one sample of RNA-seq reads, select the corresponding library object.
    assembly_or_genome_ref :
        ui-name : |
            Assembly or Genome
        short-hint : |
            Select the Assembly or Genome object against which to align the reads.
    alignment_suffix :
        ui-name : |
            Alignment Name Suffix
        short-hint : |
            Provide a suffix that will be appended to the name of the output Alignment.
    alignment_set_suffix :
        ui-name : |
            Alignment Set Name Suffix
        short-hint : |
            Provide a suffix that will be appended to the name of the output AlignmentSet.
    read_mismatches :
        ui-name : |
            Read Mismatch Cutoff
        short-hint : |
            Any final read alignments with more than this many mismatches are discarded.
    read_gap_length :
        ui-name : |
            Read Gap Cutoff
        short-hint : |
            Any final read alignments with more than this many gaps are discarded.
    read_edit_dist :
        ui-name : |
            Read Edit Cutoff
        short-hint : |
            Any final read alignments with more than this many edits are discarded.
    min_intron_length :
        ui-name : |
            Minimum Intron Length
        short-hint : |
            Donor/acceptor pairs farther than this many bases apart will be ignored.
    max_intron_length :
        ui-name : |
            Maximum Intron Length
        short-hint : |
            TopHat will ignore donor/acceptor pairs farther than this many bases apart.
    min_anchor_length :
        ui-name : |
            Minimum Anchor Length
        short-hint : |
            TopHat will report junctions spanned by reads with at least this many bases on each side of the junction. The minimum allowed is 3, and the default is 8.
    report_secondary_alignments :
        ui-name : |
            Report Secondary Alignments
        short-hint : |
            Use this option to output secondary alignments.
    no_coverage_search :
        ui-name : |
            No Coverage Search
        short-hint : |
            Disable the coverage-based search for junctions.
    library_type :
        ui-name : |
            Library Type
        short-hint : |
            Select the direction of the reads with respect to the original mRNA when the library was prepared. The default is fr-unstranded.
    preset_options :
        ui-name : |
            Bowtie2 Alignment Preset Options
        short-hint : |
            Select Bowtie2 to map reads in faster vs. more sensitives modes.
    reads_condition:
        ui-name : |
            RNA-seq Reads Condition
        short-hint : |
            Set the condition for the reads, if there is one ReadsLibrary or sample. Ignore this for a set of multiple samples.
description : |
    <p>This App aligns the sequencing reads from a ReadsLibrary or a sample set of reads to long reference sequences of an Assembly or a Genome using HISAT2 and outputs corresponding Alignments in BAM format.</p>

    <p>In addition, it outputs the Qualimap-generated BAM QC report for each Alignment(Set), which includes a global and individual sample-wise summary of the number of mapped reads, coverage, GC-content, mapping quality, etc. in tabular format and various plots such as PCA and coverage histograms to visualize the tabular data.</p>

    <p>TopHat2 is a fast splice junction mapper for RNA-Seq reads that first aligns reads using the Bowtie mapper and then analyzes the mapping to characterize splice junctions. HISAT2 is a successor of TopHat2 and is also available in KBase.</p>

    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This App is one of the steps of the <a href= "http://kbase.us/expression-analysis/"> Transcriptomics and Expression Analysis in KBase </a> </p>

    <p><strong>Team members who developed & deployed algorithm in KBase:</strong> Tianhao Gu, Christopher Henry, Shane Canon, Stephen Chan, Jason Baumohl, Sean McCorkle, Sunita Kumari, Shinjae Yoo, Priya Ranjan, and Vivek Kumar.
